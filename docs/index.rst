tunax documentation
===================

This package is a framework for doing differential calibration of physical closures of the vertical components of global ocean models. To obtain the differentiability, *Tunax* is written in JAX. The parameters of these closures are calibrated using the databases of "obersations" that are typically outputs of LES ('Large Eddy Simulations').
